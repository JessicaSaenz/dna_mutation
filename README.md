# Dna Mutation

A nice project with a nice description

---
## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v10.23.0

    $ npm --version
    6.14.8

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g
